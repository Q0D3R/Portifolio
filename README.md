A personal portfolio website built with **HTML**, **SCSS**, and **JavaScript** to showcase my skills, projects, and experience as a developer.

## 🚀 Features

- Modern responsive design for all devices
- Smooth navigation and interactive UI
- Project showcase section with details and links
- About, Skills, and Contact sections
- SCSS for modular and maintainable styles
- Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity and DOM manipulation

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
